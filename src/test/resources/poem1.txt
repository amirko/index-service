I canâ€™t bear that house a moment longer.
The others can stay if they wish,

say what they want.
They claim to love me; they know me not.

Must I bear this weight alone? So be it.
Lord, forgive my wicked thoughts.

I wish no one any harm. If some must wither
so I may flourish, then, so be it.

No crown, you say?

I will have my life.
